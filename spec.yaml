  principles:
    - Tie every vision to unit economics and cash-flow reality.
    - Prefer simple, auditable structures over opaque complexity.
    - Align incentives across investors, communities, environment (shared gain).
  practices:
    - Opportunity memo (≤1 page): problem, value, unit economics, risks, milestones.
    - Decision gates: Idea → Memo → Pilot → Scale (owner, metrics, date).
    - Weekly pipeline review: win/loss notes + next best action.
